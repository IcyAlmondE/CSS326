-- Lab 9 - Exercise 1 : Run a transaction by hand (MySQL Workbench)
-- Run each block separately (highlight it, then Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter)
-- and look at the result grid after every step.

USE lab_9;

-- Step 1: add the seats column (a course is 'full' when seats = 0)
--         Each course holds 30 students in total.
-- TODO: write the ALTER TABLE statement here (DEFAULT 30)
ALTER TABLE courses ADD seats INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 30;


-- Step 1b: DEFAULT 30 gives EVERY course 30 free seats, but some students
-- are already enrolled. seats means FREE seats, so subtract them:
-- WHERE c.id > 0 matches every row: Workbench's Safe Updates mode refuses an
-- UPDATE without a WHERE on a key column (Error 1175).
UPDATE courses c
   SET seats = 30 - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrolments e WHERE e.course_id = c.id)
 WHERE c.id > 0;

SELECT id, title, seats FROM courses;   -- e.g. course 1 has 2 students -> 28

-- Step 2: note the "before" state
SELECT id, title, seats FROM courses WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM enrolments WHERE student_id = 3 ORDER BY course_id;

-- Step 3: take a seat and enrol student 3 in course 1, then ROLLBACK
START TRANSACTION;
-- TODO: reduce course 1's seats by one
UPDATE courses SET seats = seats - 1 WHERE id = 1;
-- TODO: insert an enrolment for student 3 in course 1
INSERT INTO enrolments (student_id, course_id) VALUES (3, 1);
ROLLBACK;

-- Step 4: check again - what happened to seats and enrolments?
SELECT id, title, seats FROM courses WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM enrolments WHERE student_id = 3 ORDER BY course_id;

-- Step 5: repeat Step 3, but finish with COMMIT instead of ROLLBACK
-- TODO
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE courses SET seats = seats - 1 WHERE id = 1;
INSERT INTO enrolments (student_id, course_id) VALUES (3, 1);
COMMIT;


-- Step 6: check a final time
SELECT id, title, seats FROM courses WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM enrolments WHERE student_id = 3 ORDER BY course_id;

-- UPDATE courses SET seats = 2 WHERE id = 4;
