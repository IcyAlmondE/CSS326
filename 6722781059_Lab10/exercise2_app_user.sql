-- Exercise 2: A least-privilege app user
-- Database: css326_lab10
-- PART A: run this part while connected as root (your admin connection).
USE css326_lab10;

-- Step 1. Create a user just for the app.
-- TODO: CREATE USER 'university_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '...';
ALTER USER 'university_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'a_strong_password';

-- Step 2. Grant it only SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on css326_lab10.
-- TODO: GRANT ...
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON css326_lab10.* TO 'university_app'@'localhost';

-- Step 3. Check what the user is allowed to do.
-- TODO: SHOW GRANTS FOR ...
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'university_app'@'localhost';

-- Step 4. Make a scratch table that we will try to drop as the app user later.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drop_test (id INT);

-- Step 5. Take DELETE away, check again, then give it back.
-- TODO: REVOKE ... FROM ...
-- TODO: SHOW GRANTS FOR ...
-- TODO: GRANT ... TO ...
REVOKE DELETE ON css326_lab10.* FROM 'university_app'@'localhost';
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'university_app'@'localhost';
GRANT DELETE ON css326_lab10.* TO 'university_app'@'localhost';
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'university_app'@'localhost';

-- PART B: in Workbench, create a NEW connection (the + next to MySQL Connections)
-- with Username = university_app, open it, and run the lines below there.
SELECT CURRENT_USER();                 -- should show university_app@localhost
SELECT * FROM css326_lab10.students;   -- should work
DROP TABLE css326_lab10.drop_test;     -- should FAIL with ERROR 1142 (DROP command denied)
-- (We use the scratch table drop_test so nothing important is lost if you run
--  this line in the root connection by mistake.)

-- PART C: point the app at the new user (see Exercise 3, config/db.js), restart it,
-- and confirm the app still works.
